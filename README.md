>>HTML/CSS<<
This repository mainly highlights the frontend projects I developed while completing Scrimba’s HTML & CSS program(https://scrimba.com/learn-html-and-css-c0p). As an individual who's expanding their Software engineering skill set,
I approached each project with a focus on building industry‑ready fundamentals: clean structure, maintainable styling, and responsive design. Started with simple page layouts and gradually evolved into more polished designs.
Throughout the course, I worked on a range of practical interfaces and layouts—each reinforcing core competencies that matter in real development environments. These projects helped me improve my abilities to:
# Write semantic, accessible HTML that supports both usability and long‑term scalability

# Build organized, modular CSS using modern layout systems such as Flexbox

# Apply responsive design principles to ensure consistent performance across devices

# Translate design requirements into functional, visually coherent user interfaces

# Iterate on visual hierarchy, spacing, and typography to improve clarity and user experience

# Some Media files in this repo were generated using some AI tools like Gemini's Nano Banana, and loudly.com

Beyond technical execution, I've learnt to quickly adapt to new tools, and deliver polished work with attention to detail. It also serves as a foundation for my continued growth into JavaScript, component‑based development, and full‑stack engineering.

It's another stage in my journey toward becoming a well‑rounded software engineer who can contribute to both the technical and visual aspects of product development.
